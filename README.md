# Meditation


## Description

So you want a quick meditation, but every meditation site has a gazillion choices. It takes 20 minutes just to find the one you want, and then you have to go to work! They say too many choices make us unhappy. Here's the solution: five meditations to choose from. If you start obsessing, just choose #5 and be done with it. 

To run the gem from the command line:  meditation-start

Happy calm!

Welcome to my CLI Data Gem project for the Flatiron School. It began as a more ambitious gem that scraped four sites and brought you four different types of info and wisdom with which to begin your day. It went wide instead of deep. I put that on hold to create this new version, which scrapes the Audio Dharma site to bring you a choice of five meditative talks.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'meditation'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install meditation

## Usage
To use CLI-Meditation: ruby bin/meditation-start in your console. 


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
