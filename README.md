# Meditation

TODO list 
1. create the scraper
2. push data to create meditation instances. 
3. connect to cli display

So you want a quick meditation, but it seems like every meditation site has a gazillion choices! It takes 20 minutes just to find the one you want. What do they say about too many choices making us unhappy? Here's the solution: ten to choose from. If you start obsessing, just choose #5 and be done with it. 

Happy calm!

Welcome to my CLI Data Gem project. It began as a more ambitious gem that scraped four sites and brought you four different types of info and wisdom with which to begin your day. It went wide instead of deep. I put that on hold to create this new version, which scrapes the Audio Dharma site to bring you a choice of ten meditative talks to choose from.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/meditation`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'meditation'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
