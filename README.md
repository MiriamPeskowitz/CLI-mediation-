# Meditation

NOTES -- Tuesday morning, final cleanup, and how to publish. Then see if I can get my other one working. 

So you want a quick meditation, but it seems like every meditation site has a gazillion choices and it takes 20 minutes just to find the one you want. What do they say about too many choices making us unhappy? Here's the solution: ten to choose from. If you start obsessing, just choose #5 and be done with it. 

Happy calm!

Welcome to my CLI Data Gem project. It began as a more ambitious gem that scraped four sites and brought you four different types of info and wisdom with which to begin your day. It went wide instead of deep. I put that on hold to create this new version, which scrapes the Audio Dharma site to bring you a choice of ten meditative talks to choose from.

To use CLI-Meditation: ruby bin/meditation-start in your console. 


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
